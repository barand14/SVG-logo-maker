# SVG-logo-maker

## My Task
My task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

Because this application won’t be deployed, I’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests. I’ll also need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of my project.
